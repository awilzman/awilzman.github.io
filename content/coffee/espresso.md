Espresso is amazing, but it can be easily turned into a 
sub-par drink that tastes like coffee. To avoid this, 
it must be made with fresh coffee, a careful grind size, 
and just the right amount of pressure. The amount and quality of 
flavor in an espresso is so significantly dependent on these requirements 
because it is a concentrated drink. Fresh coffee brewed at sufficient 
pressure (9 bar) will produce a foam on the surface of each shot 
from rapidly releasing CO<sub>2</sub> getting trapped within bubbles. 
Water normally cannot hold bubbles for long unless surface tension is 
increased by surfactants, which coffee certainly adds. The foam 
itself has no flavor, in fact, its probably worse than the rest 
of the drink. You can scoop it out if you want, but people usually 
just stir it in. I would not believe you if you said you could taste 
the difference. What is most profoundly different with fresh coffee, 
though, is how much flavor that can be imparted in 2 oz of water.
