# Why is caffeine cool?


I love coffee, and I always recommend it to friends as long as they drink it black,
since you get all of the great benefits of caffeine without calories, sweeteners, 
or added flavors. The quality of the coffee itself shines through, and if it tastes 
terrible the coffee is probably terrible. Try some fresh roasted stuff.<br>
But, if you enjoy it as a mixed drink that's cool too.

The fact of the matter is, caffeine is not dangerous to humans, except for those who 
are particularly sensitive to it, or are pregnant or nursing.<cite>(Nawrot P. et al.)[^1]</cite>
	
Andrew Smith published a clear and concise breakdown of how caffeine effects human behavior.
<cite>(Smith A.)[^2]</cite>
Paraphrased these points are:

1. Caffeine will increase alertness and reduce fatigue in most humans.
2. These effects will be sustained throughout easy, monotonous tasks.
3. Tasks that require complex reasoning may not benefit from caffeine use.
4. Withdrawal symptoms are not that bad relative to other drugs, and those that think 
they will have a bad time coming off of it probably will. 
5. Using caffeine regularly is fine, even preferred.
6. If you're a reasonable person, 
you will probably optimize your caffeine intake on your own.

If you want to know more about how caffeine could change you as a person,
or if you're worried about withdrawals, you can also check out a more in-depth
paper on long-term caffeine use.<cite>(Dews P.B. et al.)[^3]</cite>

It is good to note that in most people, caffeine has a half-life of around 
six hours, which means 12 hours after ingestion, a quarter of the caffeine 
will remain in your system. If this amount is not negligible by the time 
you try to go to sleep, it may increase your sleep onset latency and reduce
your overall sleep time.<cite>(Gardiner C. et al.)[^4]</cite>
