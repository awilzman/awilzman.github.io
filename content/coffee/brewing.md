There are many ways to brew coffee, but it all comes down to 
temporarily moving water through ground, roasted coffee beans. 
You can alter the temperature and pressure of the water, how long 
the interaction lasts, and how finely ground the coffee is. I've read 
papers that use ultrasound to help with extraction, but I don't think 
that's necessary to discuss.<br> On one end of the spectrum, you can 
have a shot of espresso: 2 oz of delicious, bitter-sweet, concentrated 
coffee. It's made with high pressure and temperature water passing 
through finely ground coffee. It's quick to make, which helped 
its popularity. <br> On the other side, you can coarsely grind 
your coffee and let it steep in tap-cold water overnight and end 
up with a sweeter, smoother version of coffee with all of the 
caffeine! As with everything, there are many other methods, but they 
generally vary by temperature, time, and grind size. <br>
My favorite method is pour-over, followed by espresso. 
Pour-over coffee refers to brewing coffee similar to an automatic 
drip coffee maker, but by hand! <br>
The reason to do this is to have more control over where the water 
ends up and how hot the water is. When done properly, you're 
left with a perfect cup of coffee. Sure, if you use a machine 
you don't need to be around for it, but it might miss portions of the coffee 
during the brew process if the water or coffee is not evenly 
distributed. <br>
The next best thing that doesn't require an espresso machine is 
a tie between french press and aeropress. French press is going to be 
the most convenient way to make coffee because you just coarsely grind 
your beans, immerse them in hot water, and then press a plunger five 
minutes later. Aeropress is a bit more involved, with finer ground coffee 
and a balancing act. If you're looking for convenience, this isn't the option 
to choose over french press, but it's still great for camping and travel.
