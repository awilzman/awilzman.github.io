If you're cool with caffeine you'll love coffee, please give a <mark>good</mark> cup
of coffee a shot before you decide you don't. I don't really recommend decaf, but
that can be great for people who love coffee but can't have caffeine. Tea is another
great way to get caffeine in if you really hate the flavor of coffee, but this
whole section will be about coffee. If I later go into a hyper-fixated mania about tea,
that'll just have to be another place. <br>
A <mark>good</mark> cup of coffee includes no additives, and is preferably hand-poured
by someone who knows what they're doing. I promise, if you've never tasted black coffee 
from a good shop that only uses freshly-roasted beans, you're missing out on the true
flavors of coffee. <br>
> Why is fresh coffee so great?<br>
I'm so glad you asked. The problem is CO<sub>2</sub>, or lack-thereof.
You see, while this chemical provides a warm blanket over our Earth it also
provides a blanket between all of the amazing flavors in coffee and the air!
Okay, well that might not be fully true, some of these flavors are lost to 
more stable, less tasty versions of compounds that just end up that way over time. 
Either way, as the CO<sub>2</sub> in the roasted coffee escapes, so does the 
flavor. One way to know if there's a considerable about of CO<sub>2</sub> left
in coffee is to see it brewing. Upon initial water contact, all of the CO<sub>2</sub>
will rush out, causing what coffee-people call a 'bloom'. In espresso, this bloom is 
actually pressurized and dissolved into the liquid. Once it touches air the
CO<sub>2</sub> is released, causing a foam known as 'crema'. <br>
Oh you didn't ask about all of that?<br>
Well fresh coffee just straight up tastes better, and once you grind it,
the CO<sub>2</sub> is released at an exponentially faster rate due to the 
increase in surface area. <br>


> But I like my coffee to taste the same every day<br>
No you don't. Well maybe you do, and that's great! Try fresh dark roast coffee!
It always tastes the same and it still is much better than stale dark roast.<br>


> But I like milk/sugar/etc... <br>
Sure, coffee is acidic. I think milk or alternatives are good additions to cut that 
acidity and not mask the flavor. However, sugar is straight up not needed for 
light to medium roasted coffees, that's my take. Dark roasts are definitely more
bitter, and while I can still enjoy them black, I understand most people do not.
