From [Thoughts 2](https://awilzman.github.io/posts/thoughts-2/) and [Thoughts 3](https://awilzman.github.io/posts/thoughts-3/), I envisioned something similar to deploying agents as separate LLMs that are backed by larger, parent LLMs. This as really exploded in the last couple of months as agent-based and multi-tier LLMs make their way into the market through very many different start-ups and established businesses. Subscriptions are easy to sell, as this is a growing field that benefits from lightning-fast reactions to research being published in real-time through [arXiv](https://arxiv.org). DeepSeek was really just one of the first that piggy-backed off of this, but with patent and IP laws being very loose with software, every week there's a new website/agent/assistant or whatever houses some sort of LLM. We definitely have ourselves slammed against the ceiling on this one, but how far can we push it? Will this be the straw that broke the [AGI](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/artificial-general-intelligence) camel's back? Probably not, I think we have a good bit more to figure out.
