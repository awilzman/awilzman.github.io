Popular vote is nice, but I really think the Borda count method<cite>[^1]</cite>
would improve the diversity and ultimate well-being of a democracy.<br>
The idea is to invoke a point system which depends on ordered
vectors of ranked choice rather than a single favorite vote. 
This allows for a more accurate and fair approach to deciding 
a single winner among many candidates.
