Not chilling
<!--more-->

I recently finished my research, defended my dissertation, and graduated 
from WPI. I am still working on publishing the parts of my dissertation, 
but I needed a break. I have been on the job hunt for months now and my 
break has turned into unemployment, thus boredom and learning what I can. 

In tune with my last few posts, I took an interest in LLMs and started to 
see if I could fine tune my own models. I think there could be a great 
application of personal assistance through fine-tuned LLMs that read through 
a lot of your thoughts or concerns and can give you real advice on them 
without privacy risks, assuming you use local information. The tuned models  
and all of its working memory will be stored and manipulated locally, so 
you only need to worry about who can access the model files. I can imagine that 
blockchain technology could be used to decentralize and secure access to 
models in an indirect way, but the file that holds the model parameters needs 
to be stored somewhere, and if it's online, it's hackable. 

So, I'm liking the idea of having a Raspberry Pi with a continuously-learning 
LLM, something that can be low power and battery operated. Add your calendar 
and you have something your PDA could never be.
