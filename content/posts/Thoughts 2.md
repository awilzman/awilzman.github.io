Assurance

I often find myself stuck, and in need of time 
to process thoughts, facts, and assumptions to produce 
an appropriate plan for a path forward. Sometimes these 
are as simple as syntax issues with code, and what was 
once a problem that required intense study or even 
expert advise is now usually solved well by Language 
Learning Models (LLMs) that have been trained on the 
required information. OpenAI came out with ChatGPT and 
it proved to the world that methods in deep learning 
are not to be taken lightly. The open-source, free version 
of ChatGPT is incredibly powerful and can fix syntax 
issues in code, theory misunderstandings, and more 
with the right prompts. This has accelerated my work 
because it acts as a fast, efficient research tool. 
Each step of the way requires complete understanding, 
else you risk the inability to troubleshoot your own 
code or decipher your own data. Now, instead of spending 
20 minutes on Google or setting up a meeting with an 
advisor, I am able to answer many of my questions 
with ChatGPT! There are other LLMs available, and they 
can differ greatly. I've seen that NVIDIA is pouring 
some effort into creating LLM modules that can be called 
via API. They can [host however many models on their 
own servers](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover) 
for more intentional use, depending on your need. While 
ChatGPT is powerful, this technology will be improved 
upon. I can absolutely envision a society taught by, 
or more grimly, dependent on LLMs. If humans are taught 
some things for the first time via LLMs or other 
deep learning approaches, as long as the information 
is solidified and appropriately applied, what is the harm? 
<br>
There are problems that can't be solved by LLMs, of course. 
External help can reasonably be sought if you make a 
reasonable effort to do your own research beyond any 
LLM. That statement, I hope, will remain true. After some 
problems fall through these filters, we need external help, 
and you're not going to call the Ghostbusters. One of the 
best skills you can learn in life is convincing the best person 
available to help you with these problems.
