This is my first publication that includes data I personally collected. I also devised and wrote the majority
of this paper. My advisor, Karen, originally conceived of this project and handed it to me as a cool
idea that she didn't have the bandwidth to take over. She played a vital role in driving the focus
of this paper as well as helping with edits and graphic design. Devin was an undergraduate researcher 
who helped tremendously in data processing and figure design. Specifically, she helped us create a fast
and efficient process for muscle activation analysis in OpenSim.
