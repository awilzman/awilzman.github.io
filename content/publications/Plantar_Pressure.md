[Can Plantar Pressure Predict Injury?](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35734769/)

This was my initial first-author manuscript out of the MBL. This could not have been possible without the data collection efforts made by my co-authors who were at or associated with Stanford University at the time. 

I led the data analysis and writing of a manuscript using a recently-finished prospective dataset of elite collegiate runners. This included datasets generated by demographics and a session of athletic movements measured by insole pressure monitors.
