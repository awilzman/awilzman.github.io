[Effect of external and mechanical stimuli on human bone: a narrative review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36310606/)

This narrative review was authored by a PhD alumna from the MBL, Megan Mancuso. I earned this spot by helping edit and write select sections.

The focus of this manuscript was to highlight bone as an adaptable tissue in our bodies. The quality of our bone and how well it can withstand trauma or overuse depends on both the individual's genetics and the loads commonly applied to it.
