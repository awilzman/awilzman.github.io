This was my Master's Thesis and my first paper to be publicly available. 

The goal of this project was to build and test a design for a UCL-stabilizing brace, which used elastic compression across the elbow joint to reduce load on the UCL during pitching. I envisioned this device to be used for practice or rehabilitation.
