Hi, I'm Andrew Wilzman and I stay busy.
<br>

# Where am I now?

I am a PhD student in the [Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab](https://wp.wpi.edu/mbl/) at WPI.

# What am I doing here?

I am mastering computational techniques to develop cutting-edge models to predict musculoskeletal injury, currently focusing on bone stress injuries.

# What have I done so far?

You can check out my [biosketch](https://awilzman.github.io/publications/intro/).

Or just my first-authored publications:
1. [Can Plantar Pressure Predict Injury?](https://awilzman.github.io/publications/plantar_pressure/).
