# Where am I now?

I am a PhD student in the [Musculoskeletal Biomechanics Lab](https://wp.wpi.edu/mbl/) at WPI.

# What am I doing here?

I am mastering computational techniques to develop cutting-edge models to predict musculoskeletal injury, currently focusing on bone stress injuries.

# What have I done so far?

Maybe I'll just link this to a CV
